# Welcome to Ironwood Cyber Enlight™ 

Enlight™ is Ironwood Cyber's fully autonomous offensive cyber assessment platform. Whether you're a pentester looking to accelerate engagements or a business assessing your own systems, Enlight™ gives you expert-level security testing with full transparency.

This documentation covers everything you need to get started, run assessments, and understand how the platform works. It will be updated as new features are introduced.
 
## Enlight™  Documentation Structure

Effective documentation requires more than a single format.  
Our docs follow a structure based on four distinct types of content — each built for a different moment in your journey.


### Tutorials — Learn by Doing  

Step-by-step, hands-on walkthroughs that help you complete your first tasks:  

- Run your first assessment  
- Understand workflow fundamentals  

Tutorials are designed to be followed in order and assume no prior experience with our platform.

### How-To Guides — Practical, Goal-Focused Solutions  

Short, goal-oriented instructions that show you exactly how to accomplish practical tasks within the platform.

- Creating configs
- Creating seed elements
- Downloading and installing Sentry

These guides are short, direct, and designed to solve real-world tasks efficiently.

### Concepts — Design and Deep Understanding

Background and conceptual material that clarifies *why* things work the way they do:  

- Breaking down Configs and Seed Elements
- How our assessment engine maps real attack surfaces  
- The philosophy behind continuous penetration testing  

Concepts help teams make informed security decisions, not just follow steps.

By structuring our documentation this way, we make sure you can always find the right kind of help — whether you’re just getting started, troubleshooting a deployment, or integrating our platform into your security workflow.
