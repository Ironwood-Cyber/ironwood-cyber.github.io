## Enlight™  Documentation Structure

Effective documentation requires more than a single format.  
Our docs follow a structure based on four distinct types of content — each built for a different moment in your journey.


### Tutorials — Learn by Doing  

Step-by-step, hands-on walkthroughs that help you complete your first tasks:  

- Run your first assessment  
- Understand workflow fundamentals  

Tutorials are designed to be followed in order and assume no prior experience with our platform.

### How-To Guides — Practical, Goal-Focused Solutions  

Short, goal-oriented instructions that show you exactly how to accomplish practical tasks within the platform.

- Creating configs
- Creating seed elements
- Downloading and installing Sentry

These guides are short, direct, and designed to solve real-world tasks efficiently.

### Technical Reference - Integrate into your platform

API's are not yet available.

### Explanation — Concepts, Design, and Deep Understanding  

Background and conceptual material that clarifies *why* things work the way they do:  

- Breaking down Configs and Seed Elements
- How our assessment engine maps real attack surfaces

Explanations help teams make informed security decisions, not just follow steps.
