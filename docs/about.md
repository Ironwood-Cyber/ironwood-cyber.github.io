# About Enlight™ 

Enlight™  is a next generation penetration testing as a service platform that allows for external and internal cyber assessments of an organization's information systems. 

Our goal is to make security testing continuous, transparent, and accessible for every organization.  

We built this platform to simplify how teams identify vulnerabilities, validate fixes, and get expert level security at an affordable price point.

## What We Do

We provide a modern Penetration-Testing-as-a-Service (PTaaS) platform that brings together automated scanning, expert validation, and streamlined reporting.  
Our platform helps teams:

- Run on-demand or continuous cyber assessments 
- Track findings with real-time visibility  
- Collaborate with security engineers and allow them visibility to explore additional exploits
- Maintain a clear, auditable record of their security improvements  

## Why We Built This
Security testing has traditionally been slow, siloed, and difficult to operationalize.  
We wanted to solve the problems teams face every day:

- Long turnaround times/ one time snapshots  
- Reports that age quickly  
- Limited access to testers  
- Missing context behind vulnerabilities  
- Manual processes that don’t scale  

Our platform was designed to eliminate these pain points and help organizations keep pace with modern software delivery.
