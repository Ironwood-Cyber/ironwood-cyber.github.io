Production systems might need strict resource limits, while internal sandbox environments can tolerate deeper testing. Configurations let you control this balance.</p>"},{"location":"explanation/#seed-elements","title":"Seed Elements","text":"<p>Seed elements are the initial pieces of information that Enlight\u2122 uses to understand your attack surface.</p> <p>Common seed elements include:</p> <ul> <li>Domain names</li> <li>IP Subnets</li> <li>IP Addresses</li> <li>Global credentials</li> </ul> <p>From these seeds, the platform expands outward, mapping the environment and identifying related assets.</p>"},{"location":"explanation/#domain-names","title":"Domain names","text":"<p>These are used for external perimeter assessments. These are domain names like [yourcompany].com which are checked in our perimeter scan for security findings.</p>"},{"location":"explanation/#ip-subnets","title":"IP subnets","text":"<p>These are available subnets that you want assessed within an internal assessment. When this is selected, Enlight\u2122 will run an assessment on the whole known network.</p>"},{"location":"explanation/#ip-address","title":"IP address","text":"<p>This is the individual host that you want to run an assessment on. When this is selected, Enlight\u2122 will kick off assessments at the host level and from there, see if it can map out other relationships and findings within the network.</p>"},{"location":"explanation/#global-credentials","title":"Global Credentials","text":"<p>Global Credentials are creds that can be used by Enlight\u2122 to further exploit and run deeper assessments against an asset. For example, you can provide a credential like u: admin and p: password that is reused across the assessment. The purpose of providing a global credential, whether with privs or not, is to better understand the attack surface if an attacker was to compromise accounts/gain a foothold/etc.</p> <p>When credentials are found in the assessment, they create more global credential seed elements which can then be used for additional checks. All autonomously.</p> <p>Why this matters:</p> <p>A single seed element can reveal dozens or hundreds of related assets. Enlight\u2122 will be able to find related assets, but more seed elements mean a more comprehensive exploration surface.</p> <p>On the other end, incorrect or missing seeds can lead to incomplete analysis or irrelevant targets.</p> <p>Seed elements directly impact assessments. For example, if you have a seed element on a subnet in 10.0.0.1, but there is only one host there...that's all you'll see.</p>"},{"location":"explanation/#credentials-and-environment-data-understanding-authenticated-context","title":"Credentials and Environment Data: Understanding Authenticated Context","text":"<p>Many modern applications require authentication for meaningful testing.</p> <p>Providing credentials allows the platform to:</p> <ul> <li>Traverse authenticated areas</li> <li>Assess authorization controls</li> <li>Validate role-based access</li> </ul> <p>These credentials never change the nature of the testing; they simply give the engine the visibility it needs.</p> <p>Why this matters:</p> <p>Unauthenticated testing only shows one layer of risk. Authenticated testing reveals deeper, more realistic attack paths.</p>"},{"location":"explanation/#sentry-agents","title":"Sentry Agents","text":"<p>Sentry agents are created by Ironwood Cyber to facilitate secure internal assessments from our cloud Enlight\u2122 engine. Each agent registers with a license and establishes an authenticated session with our cloud services.</p> <p>Why this matters:</p> <p>External perimeter assessments are nice, but you can only truly understand your attack surface with an internal overview. Sentry helps accomplish this.</p>"},{"location":"explanation/#enlighttm-amplify","title":"Enlight\u2122 Amplify","text":"<p>Amplify is a web-based IDE view built into the platform that gives you a live, interactive window into an assessment as it runs.</p> <p>Rather than waiting for a final report, Amplify lets you:</p> <ul> <li>Browse discovered assets \u2014 see every host, domain, IP, and credential the engine has found, organized as it maps the environment</li> <li>Trace actions run \u2014 inspect the specific actions and techniques Enlight\u2122 executed against each asset, giving you full visibility into the engine's reasoning</li> <li>Understand findings in context \u2014 see not just what was found, but how it was reached and what was done to confirm it</li> </ul> <p>Why this matters:</p> <p>Traditional penetration test reports give you a snapshot at the end.
