When this is selected, Enlight\u2122  will kick off assessments at the host level and from there, see if it can map out other relationships and findings within the network.</p>"},{"location":"explanation/#global-credentials","title":"Global Credentials","text":"<p>Global Credentials are creds that can be used by Enlight\u2122  to further exploit and run deeper assessments against an asset. For example, you can provide a credential like u: admin and p: password that is reused across the assessment. The purpose of providing a global credential, whether with privs or not, is to better understand the attack surface if an attacker was to compromise accounts/gain a foothold/etc. </p> <p>When credentials are found in the assessment, they create more global credential seed elements which can then be used for additional checks. All autonomously.</p> <p>Why this matters: </p> <p>A single seed element can reveal dozens or hundreds of related assets. Enlight\u2122  will be able to find related assets, but more seed elements mean a more comprehensive exploration surface. </p> <p>On the other end, incorrect or missing seeds can lead to incomplete analysis or irrelevant targets.</p> <p>Seed elements directly impact assessments. For example, if you have a seed element on a subnet in 10.0.0.1, but there is only one host there...that's all you'll see. </p>"},{"location":"explanation/#credentials-and-environment-data-understanding-authenticated-context","title":"Credentials and Environment Data: Understanding Authenticated Context","text":"<p>Many modern applications require authentication for meaningful testing.</p> <p>Providing credentials allows the platform to:</p> <ul> <li>Traverse authenticated areas  </li> <li>Assess authorization controls  </li> <li>Validate role-based access </li> </ul> <p>These credentials never change the nature of the testing; they simply give the engine the visibility it needs.</p> <p>Why this matters: </p> <p>Unauthenticated testing only shows one layer of risk. Authenticated testing reveals deeper, more realistic attack paths.</p>"},{"location":"explanation/#sentry-agents","title":"Sentry Agents","text":"<p>Sentry agents are created by Ironwood Cyber to facilitate secure internal assessments from our cloud Enlight\u2122  engine.
